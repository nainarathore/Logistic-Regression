# Logistic Regression - Binary Classification (Breast Cancer Dataset)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **binary classifier** using **Logistic Regression** on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.  
The goal is to classify tumors as **malignant** or **benign** based on diagnostic features.

## What is done 
1. Loading of a binary classification dataset.
2 .Train/test split and standardization of features.
3. Fitting a Logistic Regression model.
4. Evaluation with confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC-AUC.
5. Tuning the threshold and explaination of sigmoid function.
